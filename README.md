# YouTrack-Automated-Field-Workflow
Automatically set the value of one field when another field is altered. In this script I update the field Cost when Estimated Time is updated to calculate the "ROI" for the ticket.
This workflow type is "On-Change" event.

# Setup
- Ensure you change fields like "Cost" and "Estimation" to your desired fields
